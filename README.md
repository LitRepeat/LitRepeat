# LitRepeat

A framework for repeatable literature studies, to serve as baseline
for reproducible and living literature studies.

## Literature Study?

A "literature study" refers to the process of identifying and
synthesizing scientific literature relevant to a particular research
question. A thorough literature study underpins any credible
scientific endeavor. At the time of writing, scientifically most
thorough, yet common literature studies, are [**Systematic Literature
Reviews
(SLRs)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/systematic-review)
and [**Systematic Mapping Studies
(SMSs?)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/systematic-mapping-study).
LitRepeat is intended to ease conducting an SLR or an SMS, but
ultimately calls for conducting reproducible and living literature
studies. Indeed, conventional SLRs and SMSs do not tend to be easy to
reproduce, while quickly loosing relevance in high-velocity fields of
science.

### Why "study" rather than "review"?

The word "review" has a retrospective taste to it. However, LitRepeat
aims to underpin more future-oriented reproducible and living
literature "reviews".  Piggy-banking on the conflation of the words
"review" and "study" in SLRs and SMSs, "study" perhaps better fits
LitRepeat, but this isn't set in stone.
